# Node Blog posts
CRUD API for blog posts

Here are the requirements for this app:
- Use npm init to create it afresh.
- It should support the four CRUD operations for a blog posts resource.
- GET and POST requests should go to /blog-posts.
- DELETE and PUT requests should go to /blog-posts/:id.
- Use Express router and modularize routes to /blog-posts.
- Add a couple of blog posts on server load so you'll automatically have some data -to look at when the server starts.
